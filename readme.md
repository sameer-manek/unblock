# UNBLOCK / RUSH HOUR in raylib (Golang)

This is a small game I developed to learn golang. The code is of real bad quality, but game works (somehow!).

Huge shoutout to [https://github.com/fogleman/rush][fogleman/rush] project I used for generating levels.

#### You can alter size of the grid by changing value of var Puzzle size in game/PuzzleSize.
